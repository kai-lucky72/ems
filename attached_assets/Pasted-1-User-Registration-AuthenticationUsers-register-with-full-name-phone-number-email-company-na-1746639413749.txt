1. User Registration & AuthenticationUsers register with: full name, phone number, email, company name, and password.
Secure login using email and password.
Each registered user manages their own isolated instance of the system.
Use JWT for stateless authentication and secure session management.
2. Department ManagementManagers can create, update, and delete departments.
Assign each department a monthly or yearly salary budget.
Visual indicators when department expenses exceed budget.
3. Employee ManagementAdd employees with: name, email, phone, role/title (e.g., Finance Head, Sales Staff), department, contract type (Full-time, Part-time, Remote), and contract duration (start–end date).
Assign each employee to a department.
Mark employees as active or inactive, and record inactive periods (with dates).
4. Salary ManagementEnter gross salary for each employee.
Add structured deductions:
Tax (% or fixed)
Insurance
Custom deductions (label + amount)

Auto-calculate net salary = gross salary – total deductions.
Prevent total monthly salaries in a department from exceeding its allocated budget.
5. Leave ManagementManagers can add leave requests for employees in real-time.
Requests can be approved or denied, and status is stored.
Track historical leave data per employee (date, reason, decision).
If approved, employee is marked as on leave for specified period.
6. Messaging SystemManagers can send emails directly to employees.
Compose message by selecting employee name or email.
Use the manager’s registered email account (via SMTP/SendGrid API) to authenticate and send messages.

7. Analytics & DashboardProvide an interactive dashboard with:
Department-wise budget usage
Salary analytics (total, average, gross vs. net)
Active/inactive employee trends
Leave status breakdown
Role distribution (e.g., how many Finance Heads, Staff, etc.)
Use libraries like Recharts, Chart.js, or D3.js.
8. Technology RecommendationsFrontend: React + Tailwind CSS or Next.js (TypeScript preferred)
Backend: Java (Spring Boot) with layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
Database: MySQL with clear entity relationships
Email Integration: SMTP or SendGrid (REST API) for secure email delivery
Security: JWT auth, role-based access control, rate limiting, and input validation
Build the application to be clean, responsive, and scalable. The architecture should be modular and future-proof to support:
Payroll export (PDF/Excel)
Audit logs
